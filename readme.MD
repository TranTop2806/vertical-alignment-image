# VerticalAlignment Project

## Overview
This project is part of a programming assignment aimed at developing a Python application to automatically align interior images by detecting and correcting vertical misalignment. Proper alignment of vertical elements (such as walls and doors) in photos is crucial, especially in real estate photography, where well-aligned images can attract user interest.
